Laboratories
============

* * *

Knowledge without practical application is of no use, at least for a Mechanical Engineer. For this we have all kinds of laboratories which include  
  

### COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN

* * *

The CAD laboratory of the college is one of the best in the region with state of the art software and hardware. CAD lab has the following software's:

1.  ANSYS
2.  FLUENT
3.  CATIA
4.  Pro- Engineer
5.  AutoDesk Inventor
6.  AutoCAD

### APPLIED THERMODYNAMICS

* * *

The applied thermodynamics lab has a number of models, cut sections and experimental setups to make the students conversant with actual engines and measurement of their performance.

### MECHANICS OF MATERIALS

* * *

The objective of this lab is to provide know-how to evaluate the different mechanical properties of various materials. Advanced facilities like creep testing, fatigue testing, torsion testing, Hardness testing machines are available apart from the basic testing facilities.

### MECHATRONICS

* * *

This lab is a merger of mechanical instruments with computers and electronics .This gives an idea of hydraulics and pneumatics coupled with simulation kits. A complete set up of hydraulic training kit and pneumatic training experimental equipment is available.

### HEAT TRANSFER

* * *

The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate the students about the different heat transfer processes like conduction, convection & radiation with the help of equipments and also to make them understand different heat exchangers, heat pipes practically. It also aims at calculating heat transfer coefficients, thermal conductivity and Stefan's Boltzmann's coefficient. This lab is equipped with complete setup for performing the experiments.
